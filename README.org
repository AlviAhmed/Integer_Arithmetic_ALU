* Integer_Arithmetic_ALU  
** Goal 
   - Design a simple integer arithmetic ALU that can add and substract 2 numbers.   

** Specifications
   - The 2 inputs are A and B
   - The ALU itself will have an op-code that will be used to specifiy an addition or subtraction operator
   - The B input however is the output of a barrel shifter that has other various parameters, including the enable, left and right shift, as well as shift amount.
   - The program will contain testcases that will later be simulated and the time data will be traced using GTKWAVE
