* Integer_Arithmetic_ALU  
** Goal 
   - Design a simple integer arithmetic ALU that can add and substract 2 numbers.   

** Specifications
   - The 2 inputs are A and B
   - The ALU itself will have an op-code that will be used to specifiy an addition or subtraction operator
   - The B input however is the output of a barrel shifter that has other various parameters, including the enable, left and right shift, as well as shift amount.
   - The program will contain testcases that will later be simulated and the time data will be traced using GTKWave

*** ALU and Barrel Functionality   

| ALU |               | Barrel Shifter |     |                                       |
| Op  | Functionality |             en | l_r | Functionality                         |
| 0   | Substract     |              0 |   X | Pass Data through (shifting disabled) |
| 1   | Addition      |              1 |   0 | Shift left by shift_amount            |
| N/A | N/A           |              1 |   1 | Shift right by shift_amount           |
