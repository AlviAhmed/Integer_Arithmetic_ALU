#+TITLE: Integer Arithmetic ALU
#+AUTHOR: Alvi Ahmed
*Status:* Completed 
*Type:* COE838 Lab

* Goal 
  - Design a simple integer arithmetic ALU that can add and substract 2 numbers.   

* Specifications
  - The 2 inputs are A and B
  - The ALU itself will have an op-code that will be used to specifiy an addition or subtraction operator
  - The B input however is the output of a barrel shifter that has other various parameters, including the enable, left and right shift, as well as shift amount.
  - The program will contain testcases that will later be simulated and the time data will be traced using GTKWave
* Figures  and Tables 
** ALU and Barrel Functionality

barrelshifter and ALU

** Test Cases and Results 

[[./table_of_cases.png]]

Table of Cases used in the simulation, results in the format of Decimal (Hexadecimal) 


The following test cases were chosen to test every kind of combination and case for each port of the Integer Arithmatic ALU.  

As can be seen from the images below the test cases worked out as
planned and the results correlate with the predicted results shown in
the table above.
